# WATSON Tracer experiment data


These tracer data were collected during a fall training school about isotopic tracer and labelling experiments, as part of the COST Action WATSON. The training school took place near Florence, Italy, between 12-14 September 2023.


## Experiment Design and Chronology

The main idea behind the experiment was to apply labeled water on top of a soil plot and track it over space and time.

We considered a plot of 3 m<sup>2</sup> (square of 1.75 m x 1.75 m) at the Training School venue ([see on Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LWNWN5TZWTygcvvv9)). The plot had a very mild south-facing slope.
 
We used 3 tracers to label the water:
- **Brilliant Blue dye**, to visually see the spatial distribution of the tracer
- **NaCl**, to measure the resulting pulse in Electrical Conductivity (EC) through EC sensors that measure at high temporal resolution
- **Deuterium**, to see the tracer in soil profiles analysed for their water isotope composition

## Irrigation 1 

On Sep 12 2023, between 17:40 and 20:00 we applied the three tracers together in a single irrigation (80 liters / 27 mm of tap water) using manual sprayers.

The applied water was labeled with:
- 4 g/l of Brilliant Blue dye
- 5 g/l of NaCl (which should make an EC of about 7000 uS/cm)
- 62.5 ug/l of D2O water at 99.99% (which should make the d2H of the solution about +330 permil)

## Irrigation 2

On Sep 13 2023 between 18:30 and 20:45 we applied another 28 mm of tap water <u> that only had NaCl (5 g/l) and not the other tracers</u>. The goal was to better see a breakthrough in the EC signal while pushing down the other tracers.

## Measurement strategy

### Brilliant Blue dye 

![](DyeImageData/TransectsScheme.png)

We excavated 4 transects and collected 2 pictures (a and b) from each of them. More details are in the [DyeImageData](DyeImageData) folder.

### NaCl 

![](ECSensorData/SensorsScheme.png)

We measured the pulse in EC at 9 locations:
- 'Left' side, at depths 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm  
- 'Middle' side at depths 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm 
- 'Right' side at depths 10 cm and 20 cm

More details are in the [ECSensorData](ECSensorData) folder.

### Deuterium

We colleced soil profiles in 5 different days from 2 profiles each day (total 10 profiles). Profiles A-B were collected before the tracer was applied, to evaluate the background condition. Profiles C-D were collected the day after the tracer application, profiles E-F after another day (after the second, unlabeled irrigation), profiles G-H and I-J were collected after about 1 and 2 weeks respectively. The Bulk soil samples were analysed using the Direct Vapor Equilibratin method at the University of Braunschweig.
